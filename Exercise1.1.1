Answer 3:To view the contents of the ~/.gitconfig file, I can use cat command.The command is: cat ~/.config

git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "Myemail@example.com       
                                     
I will see corresponding entries in the file:

[user]
    name = My Name
    email = Myemail@example.com
